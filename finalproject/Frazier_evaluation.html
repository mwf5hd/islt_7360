<h1>Evaluation of Marcell Frazier's Pilot Site</h1>

<!--General Site Information--> 
<h2>I. General Site Information</h2>

<p><b>URL of site evaluated:</b><a href="https://mwf5hd.github.io/islt_7360/pilotsite/frazier_pilot.html">https://mwf5hd.github.io/islt_7360/pilotsite/frazier_pilot.html</a></p>

<!--Evaluator Information-->
<h2>II. Evaluator Information</h2>

<p><b>Evaluator 1: Mariah</b></p>
<p>Mariah is a high school junior in at David Douglas High School in Portland, Oregon. She is the sister of one of my friends from Portland. Mariah was chosen to be a part of this evaluation because she would be considered part of the target audience.</p>
<p>For this evaluation, Mariah used an HP EliteBook Folio G1 Notebook PC (Intel Core m5-6Y54, 1.1 GHz, 4 MB cache, 8GB LPDDR#-1866 SDRAM with integrated Intel HD Graphics) on an Ethernet connection. She used Internet Explorer as her browser.</p>

<p><b>Evaluator 2: Jay</b></p>
<p>Jay is a program coordinator at a local community organization in Portland, Oregon that connects students to college resources through after school programming. I know her through family connections. Jay was chosen to be a part of this evaluation because she would be working with the target audience, and is also familiar with the website content.</p>
<p>For this evaluation, Jay used an HP Chromebook 11 G5 (Intel Celeron processor, 16 GB eMMC, 1.6-2.1 GHz, 2 MB cache with Intel HD Graphics) on a wireless connection. She used Google Chrome as her browser.</p>

<p><b>Evaluator 3: Thomas</b></p>
<p>Thomas is one of my friends at Mizzou who is very familiar with HTML coding and has experience with graphic design. He was selected for this evaluation to provide feedback on the aesthetics of the site, and also to look over my HTML code.</p>
<p>For this evaluation, Thomas used the same computer as I did for my first web evaluation assignment, which is a Mac running OS X Yosemite, 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB. He used Safari as his browser on a wireless connection.</p>

<!--Summary of Evaluators' Comments-->
<h2>III. Summary of Evaluators' Comments</h2>
<p>All three of the evaluators enjoyed the site, with an average appearance score of 4.8 out of 5 and an average content score of 4.7 out of 5. The two pages that were complete before the evaluation were the <a href="/islt_7360/pilotsite/frazier_pilot.html">Home</a> and <a href="/islt_7360/pilotsite/institutions.html">Institutions</a> pages.</p>

<p>Regarding the <a href="/islt_7360/pilotsite/frazier_pilot.html">Home</a> page, all three evaluators thought that the fonts and colors were nice. All three evaluators also said that the table with a short description of each page was very helpful, since it would direct them to where they wanted to go. The points of constructive feedback regarding the homepage were:</p>
<ul><li>Mariah said that the colors were simple overall, but she tends to like more vibrant color choices. She did say that this was only a matter of personal preference, but still wanted to note it.</li>
<li>Thomas said that the borders on the table were too thick, which was not very aesthetically pleasing. This was actually a criticism that I held myself of the page as well, but could not figure out how to fix it in the HTML code. Thomas gave me some pointers that should help solve this issue in my code.</li></ul>

<p>Regarding the <a href="/islt_7360/pilotsite/institutions.html">Institutions</a> page, the overall reaction was very positive. The only criticism was from Jay, who said that it might be easier to read if there were two columns of content, one for two-year and another for four-year institutions. That way, students don’t have to scroll all the way down to get to the latter.</p>

<p>A summary of the evaluation data is included in the table below. The evaluators were asked to rank each section on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent.</p>

<!--Use Cases-->
<h2>IV. Use Cases</h2>
<p>Based on the evaluator feedback, I would say that my website does successfully support one of the use cases that I outlined in my design document. For reference, the three use cases from my <a href="/islt_7360/finalproject/FrazierM_designDocument.html">design document</a> are:
<ol><li>A student with no prior knowledge about colleges in Portland coming to the site to be directed to a list of schools</li><li>A student with some prior knowledge about schools coming to the site to be connected with community organizations</li><li>A student coming to the site looking for information about test dates and deadlines</li></ol></p>

<p>So far, the website is able to support the first, as the <a href="/islt_7360/pilotsite/institutions.html">Institutions</a> page is complete and users can navigate the list of schools and other related resources. The functionality is very simple on this page, which connects the users to the page objectives. At this point, the other two use cases have not been supported, but this is only due to the fact that the site is incomplete. I fully anticipate being able to connect the use cases to site functionality fully through the final website, and do not anticipate any reasons why this would not be fulfilled. </p>
<br>

<!--Recommended/Planned Design Changes-->
<h2>V. Recommended/Planned Design Changes</h2>
<p>Based on the feedback from the evaluators, I plan to make the following changes to the design:
<ol><li>Make the borders on the <a href="/islt_7360/pilotsite/frazier_pilot.html">homepage</a> table more narrow - this will improve the overall design of the <a href="/islt_7360/pilotsite/frazier_pilot.html">homepage</a></li><li>Add more colors (from the color palette in the <a href="/islt_7360/finalproject/FrazierM_designDocument.html">design document</a>, likely more green) on the rest of the pages - this will incorporate Mariah’s suggestion to make the site more vibrant</li><li>Change the layout of the <a href="/islt_7360/pilotsite/institutions.html">Institutions</a> page to a two-column layout - this will take some manipulation in the HTML code that might change the formatting in other ways, but I will strive to make this improvement for the final site</li></ol></p>
<br>

<!--Reflection on Evaluation Process-->
<h2>VI. Reflection on Evaluation Process</h2>
<p>Overall, I thought that this evaluation process was very helpful. In addition to the informative evaluation process with my classmates on the discussion boards, it was nice to get some feedback from people who would be considered “experts” on the site in some capacity. The observation and interview methods were helpful, especially the latter because it allowed me to ask follow-up questions and brainstorm potential solutions to some of the constructive criticisms. The evaluation data was less helpful for me, since I prefer a more qualitative approach to a quantitative one, but it was a good way to quantify the overall feedback in at least some way.</p>

<p>It was also extremely useful to have three different evaluators, two with experience with the site content and one with experience in coding and design. Although Thomas did not have any idea about the actual content that was laid out on the site, he was able to give unbiased feedback about the aesthetics of the site and offer tangible coding solutions to some of the problems I was facing. Overall, this was a very useful assignment and I look forward to incorporating this feedback into my final website.</p>
