<h1>Marcell Frazier's Design Document</h1>

<p>This document will explain the content and organization of the site that I will create for my final project in Intro to Web Development.</p>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This website will be used as a resource for high school students in the Portland metropolitan area who are interested in pursuing higher education. It will house information about two- and four-year institutions in the area, as well as scholarship opportunities and information about community organizations that students can contact for college preparatory guidance and resources. The purpose is really to serve as a place where students (and even parents and high school guidance counselors) can come for information about college, regardless of their level of previous knowledge about the process of applying and securing financial assistance and/or community support.</p>

<h2>Target Audience:</h2>
<p>The target audience for this site will be high school students in the Portland area. These students will likely come from a wide range of demographics and some might have access to ample information about college already, while others may have more limited access. The site will be useful for students no matter what their backgrounds are, as they can access as little or as many resources as they would like. The site can also be accessed by parents and guidance counselors, as much of the information is also relevant to them, but it will be specifically targeted at the students themselves.</p>

<b><u>Needs Assessment:</u></b>

<p>In order to decide what information to include on the site, and how to organize it in order to best serve the target audience, I interviewed four students from my high school in Portland, Oregon. Two students were rising juniors and two were rising seniors. I chose to include both rising juniors and seniors because they will vary in level of prior knowledge about collegiate opportunities. I asked the group five total questions. The questions and responses (summarized) from my interviews are outlined below.</p>

<p><b>Which of the following sections would be the most and least useful for you in researching information about college?</b></p>

<ol>
<li>List of several two- and four-year institutions in the Portland area (including descriptions of each with information such as cost of attendance, majors offered, specialty programs, enrollment statistics, demographics, etc.)</li>
<li>Scholarship list</li>
<li>Community organizations that work with high school students to prepare them for college (and their relevant contact information)</li>
<li>General information about college requirements, such as SAT and ACT test dates</li>
</ol>

<p>According to the group, the most useful sections were (1) and (3). The rising juniors both said they would find the list of colleges most helpful because they aren’t really sure what their options are at this point. The rising seniors both said that the list of community organizations would be great because as they narrow down their college search, they will need help identifying opportunities that are tailored to their needs and talents, and will also need help with things like securing recommendation letters and writing application essays.</p>

<p>The group agreed that none of the proposed sections would be unnecessary, as they could find each useful to varying degrees. As is, however, the scholarship page is actually what seems to be least useful to students, as they said plenty of well-done databases already exist. A solution that we brainstormed together is to have the page on my site contain minimal information and simply point them in the direction of other databases that are far more detailed and contain more specific information about opportunities.</p>

<p><b>What are the biggest challenges that you face in accessing resources regarding college opportunities?</b></p>

<p>All four of the students said that the biggest challenge they face in the college application/admissions process is simply not knowing where to look for information, since there is so much out there that it is easy to get overwhelmed with it all. They agreed that guidance counselors in the public schools are often overworked and under-resourced, so they are not always able to provide as much individual help and guidance as the students need.</p>

<p>Another area that students find is sometimes lacking is in mentorship. They said it would be helpful for them to be connected to students who are in college in the Portland area, so that they could ask personalized questions about their experiences and the application/discernment process.</p>

<p><b>Would you rather see more information on this one site about individual schools or would it be easier for this site to provide links to other websites with more detailed information?</b></p>

<p>Students agreed that they would rather have a site that gives broad information about a variety of topics and resources, and then provides links to other sites that give more detail. This goes back to them feeling overwhelmed by a lot of information when looking into college opportunities. They said it would be most helpful for this site to give an overview of what’s out there and then they can pick and choose which areas they want to learn more about by visiting other more detailed and specific sites.</p>

<p><b>How do you currently access information about college?</b></p>

<p>All four of the students said that the biggest way they access information about college is online, sometimes on their own or with the help of their guidance counselor (however, as discussed before, sometimes this resource is limited). They agreed that Internet access is typically easy for students to come by, because even those without personal computers have access to computers at most schools or public libraries if they need to look something up about college.</p>

<b><u>Use Cases:</u></b>

<p>Based on my interview with the students, the three use cases that I will use for my design conceptualization are: (1) a student with no prior knowledge about colleges in Portland coming to the site to be directed to a list of schools, (2) a student with some prior knowledge about schools coming to the site to be connected with community organizations, and (3) a student coming to the site looking for information about test dates and deadlines. In the content section, I will connect each use case to particular functions that will be used in my site, explaining why each was chosen and how I anticipate the site will be navigated for each different purpose.</p>

<h2>Presentation of Information:</h2>

<b><u>Content Synopsis:</u></b>

<p>Based on the feedback I received, along with research from other sites, I have chosen to include the following pages on my site:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Institutions</u> - a list of the top 10-15 institutions in the Portland area (both two- and four-year), each including a picture and basic information about enrollment and programs as well as a link to other sites for more information</li>
<li><u>Scholarships</u> - a list of Portland specific scholarships as well as links to other databases for different types of scholarships; also will include basic information about FAFSA/CSS and (need-based) financial aid </li>
<li><u>Resources</u> - a list of Portland community organizations that work with high school students to connect them to resources, each with a brief description and a link to their websites</li>
<li><u>Checklist</u> - a timeline of SAT and ACT dates, as well as a checklist graphic of the elements of a college application</li>
<li><u>Ask a Student</u> - a form that students can fill out with their interests that will connect them to a college student in the Portland area who they can talk to about opportunities and applying (this will obviously need more back-end work than is within the scope of the class, but is an idea that I would like to look into and incorporate in future projects)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Website Organization:</u></b>

<p>The general site organization will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>All Pages</u> - All pages will include the following elements: Banner logo at the top, Horizontal navigation bar (same on all pages with the selected page highlighted in a different color), Footer with contact information</li>
<li><u>Home</u> - The home page will be laid out in five columns, one for each section with a brief description of each (and a graphic/photo for each). There will be a single column introduction at the top and single column footer at the bottom, consistent with other pages. See the wireframe document at the bottom of this page for a visual.</li>
<li><u>Subpages (all 5)</u> - Single column layout with content under four screen lengths maximum (I only anticipate needing about three per page)
</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Media:</u></b>

<p>I will create the banner logo using a photo editor, probably Pages for Mac. All other images used will be from the websites that I will use to gather information from (about different universities, organizations, etc.) All photos will be properly credited to their owners. In the footer of the site, I will also include a statement that reads: “All images used in this site have been credited to their owners. I do not own the rights to any images used on this site.”</p>

<b><u>Color Scheme and Rationale:</u></b>

<p>I will be using the colors from the Portland, Oregon city flag as the main colors for this page (yellow/gold, blue, and green). The main background color will be white and these three colors will be used as accent colors. The fonts will be navy blue when up against the light colors and white when up against darker colors. This is so that it is easier to read, but yet still consistent and aesthetically simple. You can view the sample colors for this site below:</p>

<p style="background-color:#00693c; border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em; width:30%"></p>
<p style="background-color:#4b92db; border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em; width:30%"></p>
<p style="background-color:#ffb612; border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em; width:30%"></p>
<p style="background-color:#2c4372; border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em; width:30%"></p>
<p style="background-color:#ffffff; border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#000000; padding: 1em; width:30%"></p>


<b><u>Five Reference Websites:</u></b>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-search">This site</a> is an example of one that I will avoid, in terms of content style. On the homepage, there are far too many links and it is confusing how many different navigation bars there are.</li>
<li>For a good example of the type of navigation bar that I will include, see <a href="http://www.educationfirst.org/">this site</a>. I like that the font is simple and consistent, and that the page that is being read is highlighted in a different color. I will do something similar on my site.
</li>
<li>For the ask a student page, I want to collect information about the user so that they can be matched with a college student who shares similar interests. I do want to keep this page simple, however, so <a href="http://appsone.up.edu/PerfectForms/PresentationServer/(S(ku1tlvzlfxy1j4wllnil2f22))/Form.aspx/Play/ejBgAgIk?f=ejBgAgIk">here</a> is an example of what I would think is too crowded of a form for a site like mine.</li>
<li>I like the color scheme of <a href="http://www.scholarships.com/">this site</a>, and plan to use similar colors for mine.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bestcolleges.com/">This site</a> is an example of a site with a homepage that spans too many screen lengths. I plan to keep each page to a maximum of four screen lengths, and the homepage will ideally be only about two screen lengths, to minimize scrolling.</li></ol>
