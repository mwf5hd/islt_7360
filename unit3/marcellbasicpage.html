<h1>Marcell's Basic Webpage</h1>


<p>This is my first webpage. For my final project, I want to focus my content on community issues in my hometown of Portland, Oregon. While I am strongly leaning towards the first of the two ideas explained below, I am passionate about both topic areas.</p>

<h2><i>Topic 1</i></h2>
<p><b><u>Higher Education in Portland, Oregon</u></b></p>
<p>My first idea is to create a site that will house information about post-secondary educational opportunities and scholarships in the Portland, Oregon area, as well as information about community organizations that high school students can utilize to prepare for college. The four main pages of the site would be:
<ol>
<li>List of several two- and four-year institutions in the Portland area (including descriptions of each with information such as cost of attendance, majors offered, specialty programs, enrollment statistics, demographics, etc.)</li>
<li>Scholarship list</li>
<li>Community organizations that work with high school students to prepare them for college (and their relevant contact information)</li>
<li>General information about college requirements, such as SAT and ACT test dates</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2><i>Topic 2</i></h2>
<p><b><u>Community Organizing in Portland, Oregon</u></b></p>
<p>My second idea is to create a site that will serve as a resource hub for those who are interested in becoming community organizers in the Portland, Oregon area. For example, one organization, <a href="http://www.uniteoregon.org/community_organizing">Unite Oregon</a>, offers several trainings and opportunities for citizens to get involved in the community and to learn how to advocate for the issues that they care about. This organization's mission statement is as follows:
<blockquote><i>Led by people of color, immigrants and refugees, rural communities, and people experiencing poverty, we work across Oregon to build a unified intercultural movement for justice.</i></blockquote>
However, it is important that residents of the community have a place where they can go to find information about all organizations like Unite Oregon, since there are others who are providing similar services and resources. Therefore, my idea is to compile a website that would highlight many different existing efforts on this front.
